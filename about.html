            <h3>our story</h3>
            <p>JENN’s father Larry and her mother, Gail, once owned and operated Larry and Gail's Drive-In (footlong and ice cream business)
            on highway 8 close to the Hamlet of Sebringville from 1967-1974. Larry is famous for making delicious, hand-spun milkshakes,
            and has dreamt of busting out his 1953 Hamilton Beach milkshake machine to spin for the public once again! JENN founded Jenny's
            Peanut Brittle in 1999, and it has quickly become the best brittle in Stratford! Her peanut brittle sells out at culinary
            festivals, craft sales, special events, and especially at Christmas time. Jenny had outgrown her kitchen, and needed a new
            location to create her popular brittle.</p>
            <p>So the father and daughter duo went for it, opening JENN and Larry's Brittle’n Shakes & Ice Cream Cakes, a quaint little
            shop with a retro feel, on September 3, 2010, at 49 York Street, along the picturesque Avon River in Stratford, Ontario.
            We are proud to operate year-round, with a short break after Christmas to catch our breath, and now are so pleased to offer
            online ordering for your convenience. We look forward to serving you soon!</p>
